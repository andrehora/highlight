The parallel novel is a piece of literature written within, derived from, or
taking place during, the framework of another work of fiction by the same or
another author. Parallel novels or "reimagined classics" are works of fiction
that "borrow a character and fill in his story, mirror an 'old' plot, or blend
the characters of one book with those of another".

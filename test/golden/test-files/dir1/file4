William Nevins Armstrong (March 10, 1835 – October 16, 1905), aka Nevins
Armstrong and aka W. N. Armstrong, was the Attorney General of Hawaii during
the reign of King David Kalākaua. He is most widely known outside of Hawaii for
the book Around the World with a King, his insider account of King Kalākaua's
world tour in 1881. He was born in Lahaina on the island of Maui, the third of
ten children of missionaries Clarissa Chapman Armstrong and Richard Armstrong,
who later served as the second kahu (pastor) of Kawaiahaʻo Church, and
subsequently was appointed President of the Board of Education for the Kingdom
of Hawaii.

Boyde may refer to: Danish orthography is the system used to write the Danish
language. The oldest preserved examples of written Danish are in the Runic
alphabet, but by the end of the High Middle Ages the Runes had mostly been
replaced by the Latin letters. Danish currently uses a 29-letter Latin-script
alphabet, identical to the Norwegian alphabet.
